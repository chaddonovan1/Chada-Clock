# Chada-Clock
The project was to create a clock that you could have multile time zones shown
The project was straight forward but with room to try things.  

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? Nothing to crazy to fix however, learning how to do multi displays an dchange colors would have been nice.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The code was straight forward.  However, learning C++ and including Python was challanging.  Using Github forum as well as Udemy helped alot.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Combining coding programs (c++ and python for example) make it easier to solve complex problems.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
the code is simple, stable, and doesnt require massive libraies to run making it easy.
